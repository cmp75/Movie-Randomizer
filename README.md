# Movie-Randomizer

## We Decided to create this app because we want to watch a new movie but don't know which one specifically so we let the app pick it for us from the popular list.

## Our group used all of the skills we have learned in class to make a working app that randomly picks a movie from the popular category of the TMDB API and then save the results in a section using local storage we styled it using Bulma something we have not used before.

^ When you click on the randomize button you get a random movie picked from the popular category at the time it gives you the image poster, title, review, and ratings in different colors based on review score.

^ This is where you can see the last 10 movies that got pulled for you and logs them  as you keep clicking the button.
